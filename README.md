# Simple Recipe Browser Extension
## Description
Simple Recipe is a browser extension designed to extract recipe information from web pages and display it in a clear, distraction-free window. It primarily targets websites that follow the schema.org conventions for structured data, focusing on JSON-LD scripts.

## Features
- Distraction-Free Recipe Viewing: Get only the essential information: title, ingredients, and instructions.
- Support for Multiple JSON-LD Structures
- Clean, Simple Design: Easy-to-read format for examining recipe in a new window.
## Installation
TODO: Upload extension to the chrome store.

## Usage
1. Navigate to a recipe website.
2. Activate the Recipe Simplifier extension and click on "I just want the recipe" button.
3. A new window will pop up, displaying the recipe in a simplified format.
### Troubleshooting
Currently Recipe Simplifier relies on schema.org compliant websites, so it may not work on every site with a recipe. The extension will display whatever data is available. 


# TODO: Add more common issues and their solutions as they arise.
- If no recipe is found on page, change display in popup to notify user. 
- Target websites that do not relevant JSON-LD scripts through an iterative approach.
- Improve the UI of the popup.
- Improve the UI of the recipe which opens in a new window to increase readability.
- Allow for feature to save recipes into a users recipe box.
